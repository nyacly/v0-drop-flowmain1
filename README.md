## React Native mobile app

A standalone Expo project lives in [`mobile/`](mobile/) and mirrors the web experience for managing DropFlow routes. It ships with
demo data, offline persistence, and the same authentication flows used on the web.

### Getting started

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm run start
```

Then use the Expo QR code to open the native app on iOS or Android (or run `npm run android` / `npm run ios` with an attached
simulator).

### Features

- Shared authentication mock (demo@dropflow.com / demo123)
- Address management with automatic corrections and validation
- Route planning with multi-select and active run tracking
- Delivery plan workspace with stop reordering, progress, and notes
- Local persistence via AsyncStorage and one-tap demo reset
